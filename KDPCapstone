The Difference between High-Level and Low-Level Languages



A high-level language is one that is user-oriented in that it has been designed to make it straightforward for a programmer to convert an algorithm into program code. 

A low-level language is machine-oriented. Low-level programs are expressed in terms of the machine operations that must be performed to carry out a task.
