The Difference between High-Level and Low-Level Languages



A high-level language is one that is user-oriented in that it has been designed to make it straightforward for a programmer to convert an algorithm into program code. 

A low-level language is machine-oriented. Low-level programs are expressed in terms of the machine operations that must be performed to carry out a task.

S.NO	High Level Language	                                        Low Level Language
1.	It is programmer friendly language.	                          It is a machine friendly language.
2.	High level language is less memory efficient.	                Low level language is high memory efficient.
3.	It is easy to understand.	                                    It is tough to understand.
4.	It is simple to debug.	                                      It is complex to debug comparatively.
5.	It is simple to maintain.	                                    It is complex to maintain comparatively.
6.	It is portable.	                                              It is non-portable.
7.	It can run on any platform.	                                  It is machine-dependent.
8.	It needs compiler or interpreter for translation.	            It needs assembler for translation.
9.	It is used widely for programming.	                          It is not commonly used now-a-days in programming.
